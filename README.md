#Social Media Sentiment Analysis for Depression Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect signs of depression in social media posts using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We follow a step-by-step process to build an effective model for sentiment analysis.

## Steps Taken:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - The dataset was explored to understand its structure, distribution, and any potential issues.
   - We checked for class imbalances, missing values, and outliers.

2. **Feature Extraction with TF-IDF**:
   - Text data was preprocessed by tokenizing, removing stop words, and stemming.
   - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) was used to convert text into numerical features.
   - TF-IDF captures the importance of words in each document relative to the entire corpus.

3. **Classification Models**:
   - We experimented with two classifiers: **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**.
   - These models were trained on the TF-IDF features.
   - Naive Bayes is a probabilistic model, while Logistic Regression is a linear model.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - To assess model performance, we used the following metrics:
     - **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions.
     - **Precision**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
     - **Recall**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
     - **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

5. **Model Effectiveness**:
   - Our trained model demonstrated balanced scores, suggesting its effectiveness in detecting depression-related sentiment.
   - We achieved good accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. **Predictions**:
   - We applied the model to new social media posts.
   - The predictions aligned well with our expectations, indicating accurate detection of depression-related sentiment.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Dataset preprocessed and in the required format.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Used TF-IDF to transform text data into numerical features.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Trained Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression models on the TF-IDF features.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. **Deployment**:
   - The model was used for predicting the sentiment of text.
